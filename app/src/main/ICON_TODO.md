# Icon Specifications

Replace the default icons with proper ones:

## Sizes needed:
- mipmap-mdpi: 48x48px
- mipmap-hdpi: 72x72px
- mipmap-xhdpi: 96x96px
- mipmap-xxhdpi: 144x144px
- mipmap-xxxhdpi: 192x192px

## Design suggestions:
- A map pin transitioning from Google colors to OSM green
- Letter "G2O" stylized
- A bridge/arrow between two map icons
- Minimalist compass with coordinates

Tool recommendations:
- Use https://icon.kitchen for quick generation
- Or Figma/Inkscape for custom design
- Or provide a square logo and I'll adapt it

Current placeholder: Green square with "G2O" text
